## Stay Focused

* **For Profit (_'Established'_)** - Increase Revenues, Decrease Costs, Meet Competition, Enforce Regulations
* **For Profit (_'Start-up'_)** - Increase Top-Line Numbers, Increase Botton-Line Numbers, New Market Position, Meet Investors' Requirements
* **Non-Profit** - Increase Allocations, Decrease Expenditures, Perform Coopetition, Ensure Policies
* And all the while, help move the organization from existing technology to state-of-the-art technology


## Proper Mindset

* **'Sandwich' Model**
  * Research Question(s) (Bun on the top)
  * Data and Methods (Meat in the middle)
  * Understanding of Results (Bun on the bottom)
* **'Horizonal' Thinking** - Analytical Workflow
  * How Disney Does Analytics: [Disney .pdf](disney.pdf)
* **'Vertical' Thinking** - Explanatory or Predictive Power
  * Nazarian Lower- and Upper-Division Core Courses: [Business .pdf](business.pdf)


## "Rabbit Holes"

* **Analytical Methods** (e.g., statistics, machine learning, spatial analysis, network analysis, and many, many more...)
* **Data/Computational Technology** (e.g., UI, programming, cloud, file formats, security, and many, many more...)
* Bottom line: Only you can determine how far you need to go on each dimension to address a client's, boss's, or organization's issue


## Decision Trade-offs

* **Organizational Size** (_not so subtle_)
  * e.g., small firm (you are a 'jack of all trades'); large firm (most decisions have already been made for you)
* **Organizational Culture** (_subtle_)
  * e.g., Read first, listen later; or listen first, read later
