## Stay Focused

* For Profit ('Blue Chip') - Increase Revenues, Decrease Costs, Meet Competition, Enforce Regulations
* For Profit ('Start-up') - Increase Top-Line Numbers, Increase Botton-Line Numbers, New Market Position, Meet Investors' Requirements
* Non-Profit - Increase Allocations, Decrease Expenditures, Perform Coopetition, Ensure Policies
* And all the while, help move the organization from existing technology to state-of-the-art technology


## Proper Mindset

* 'Sandwich' Model
  * Research Question(s) (Bun on top)
  * Data and Methods (Meat in the middle)
  * Understanding of Results (Bun on bottom)
* 'Horizonal' Thinking - Analytical Workflow

* 'Vertical' Thinking - Explanatory or Predictive Power

## "Rabbit Holes"

* Analytical Methods (e.g., statistics, machine learning, spatial analysis, network analysis)
* Data/Computational Technology (e.g., UI, programming, cloud, file formats, scale)
* Bottom line: Only you can determine how far you need to go on each dimension to address a client's, boss's, or organization's issue


## Decision Trade-offs

* Organizational Size (not so subtle)
  * small firm (you are a 'jack of all trades'); large firm (most decisions are made for you)
* Organizational Culture (subtle)
  * Read first, listen later; or listen first, read later
